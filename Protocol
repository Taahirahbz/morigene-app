Create a git repo with license and readme file.
Clone it to your machine.
Pull the updates.
Check for node, npm (Install and update if needed).
After updating node and npm, "npx react-native init moapp" was run to create a new react native app (containing all the necessary folders).
Uninstall old CLI.
Install : "npm install -g expo-cli"
Create a new project using: "expo init moapp" (The app is called moapp)
A "blank" template was chosen for clarity.
It creates the following: 

                          moapp/
                           ├─ App.js
                           ├─ package.json
                           ├─ node_modules/
                           └─ (Expo config files)
Inside the "moapp" that has been created, run: "npm install react-native-text-recognition react-native-chart-kit react-native-svg" to install MVP dependicies.
*See App.js for the skeleton of the MVP code.*
"npm start" to run the app.

Optional: Download the Expo Go from Playstore and scan the QR code shown when running "npm start" to test the app live.
